# #README

This is a simple CRUD member management system that implements a RESTful API. It leverages Spring Web and the JPA to make it compatible with all popular SQL based databases, and can be extended using the Spring framework to deal with the most common web application purposes.

It uses PostgreSQL as the main database and has been deployed in Heroku via github. The Main branch runs locally using H2 as a in memory database.

It uses Swagger to implement a powerful, readable and accessible API. To access it just go to /swagger-ui.html for the UI version, or /api for the JSON.

It uses project lombok to reduce the amount of clutter code, and make it cleaner and easier to work with.
